# Schedule & Room Plan Component Counter

## Overview

I developed a program that reads and analyzes two data sets—a **Schedule** and a **Room Plan**—each containing components represented by icons. The goal of my project was to use the Schedule as a lookup table to identify and count the matching components present in the Room Plan, and then generate a report showing the count of each component.

## Problem Statement

The task was to develop a program that reads a Schedule and a Room Plan, both containing components represented by icons. I used the Schedule as a lookup table to identify and count the matching components present in the Room Plan. The expected output was a count of each component from the Schedule found in the Room Plan.

## Data Files

For this project, I worked with two sample data files:

- **ScheduleFile**: This file contains a list of components represented solely by icons.
- **RoomPlanFile**: This file contains a detailed layout with various components, also represented by icons.

## My Approach

1. **Parsing the Schedule**:  
   I began by extracting the list of components (icons) from the Schedule file. This step was crucial for setting up the lookup table.

2. **Analyzing the Room Plan**:  
   Next, I searched for each of these components within the Room Plan file. I employed techniques that could include image processing and pattern recognition (depending on the complexity of the icons) to ensure accuracy.

3. **Counting Matches**:  
   For every component from the Schedule, I counted how many times it appeared in the Room Plan. This involved iterating over the Room Plan and comparing against the lookup table.

4. **Result Compilation**:  
   Finally, I generated a report that lists each component from the Schedule alongside its corresponding count from the Room Plan.

## Programming Requirements

- **Language**: I used the programming language I was most comfortable with.
- **Libraries and Tools**: I incorporated external libraries for image processing and pattern recognition as needed.
- **Efficiency**: I optimized the program for both accuracy and performance, ensuring that it runs efficiently without unnecessary computational overhead.
